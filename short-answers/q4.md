# Question
Watch this (10 minute video on JSON)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM].

What is JSON? Why isn't the example below valid JSON?

```js
{
  name: "Zo",
  isCool: true,
  age: 28
}
```

# Answer
JSON is a data representation format that allows us to easily send data between web servers and web browsers, the code above is not valid JSON because each key must have the double quotations ("") to be valid syntax.
