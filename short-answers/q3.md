# Question
What is a "shallow" clone, and why can it cause bugs?

# Answer
Shallow clones are copies of an object or array, similar to PBR, they are directly referencing the value of the object or array, so any changes you make to these copies will reflect in the originals, this could cause bugs by accidentally changing an original object when we only intended to change a copy.

# Teacher Feedback

True, a shallow copy will only copy primitive data types!
