# Question
When would be a good time to use an array instead of an object, and vice versa? Please provide examples.

# Answer
If you want to store similar data in an organized fashion you could use an array, but if you'd like to utilize key-value pairs and dynamically add, remove, and modify properties, an object would be more suitable.
