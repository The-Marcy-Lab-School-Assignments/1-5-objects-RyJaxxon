# Question
What does it mean when we say something is "pass by reference" vs "pass by value." Which one is mutable?

# Answer
Pass by value is when our computer takes a copy of the value calling into the function, therefore not changing the original value.

Pass by reference is when our computer directly references the the value of the object or array we're calling, therefore changing it's original value. 

PBV refers to immutable data types (strings, numbers, booleans, null, and undefined) whereas PBR refers to mutable data types (objects and arrays).
